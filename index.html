        "The world is given me, i.e. my will enters into the world completely from outside as into something that is already there... That is why we have the feeling of being dependent on an alien will. However this may be, at any rate we are in a certain sense dependent, and what we are dependent on we can call God. In this sense God would simply be fate, or, what is the same thing: the world, which is independent of our will. I can make myself independent of fate. There are two god heads: the world and my independent I. I am either happy or unhappy, that is all. It can be said: good or evil do not exist."

         "The Will to Live, and the world as we know and experience it as a causally determined construct of phenomena brought about by (us) subjects through our perceptions, that is objectified ideas of the Will. The Will to Live, to exist, takes care of continuation of species and general ordering of entities. At the human level it is manifest as the natural egoism of the individual, each for himself, resulting in a scene of perpetual misery and strife. The world of ideas (objectifications of the Will) is in itself neither good nor bad. The horrors of the human scene result from the selfish wills of individuals as manifestations of the Will to Live. Other individuals, animals, plants, and the whole of our perceived phenomena are also suffering under the sovereignty of the Will."

        "A storm is not a thing, it's a collection of occurrences. A cloud above a mountain is not a thing, it is the condensation of humidity in the air that the wind blows over the mountain. A wave is not a thing, it is a movement of water, and the water that forms it is always different. A family is not a thing, it is a collection of relations, occurrences, feelings. And a human being?
        Of course it's not a thing; like the cloud above the moun
        tain, it's a complex process, where food, information,
        light, words, and so on enter and exit. . . . A knot of
        knots in a network of social relations, in a network of
        chemical processes, in a network of emotions exchanged
        with its own kind."

        "We are the ones who determine a particular macroscopic description. The initial low entropy of the universe, and
        hence the arrow of time, may be more down to us than
        to the universe itself. This is the basic idea.
        Think of one of the grandest and most obvious phenomena: the diurnal rotation of the skies. It is the most
        immediate and magnificent characteristic of the uni
        verse around us: it turns. But is this turning really a
        characteristic of the universe? It is not. It took us thou
        sands of years, but in the end we managed to understand
        the revolving of the heavens: we understood that it is we
        who turn, not the universe. The rotation of the heavens
        is a perspective effect due to our particular way of mov
        ing on Earth, rather than a mysterious property of the
        dynamics of the universe.
        Something similar might be true for time's arrow.
        The low initial entropy of the universe might be due to
        the particular way in which we-the physical system
        that we are part of interact with it. We are attuned to a
        very particular subset of aspects of the universe, and it is
        this that is oriented in time."

Within the limits' of our 'finite nature' we are able to feel or intuit the world as a whole, though not as a totally comprehended whole. We are at peace with the world, as we are with a work of art."
