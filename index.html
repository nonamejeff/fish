    <h1>Welcome to My Simple Scrolling Page</h1>
    <p>
        This is a simple page where content flows naturally as you scroll. Add your text, images, and anything else here.
    </p>

    <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Description of Image 1" width="600px">
    <p>
        Hereâ€™s some more text following the image. This paragraph is where you can add additional information or content related to the image above.
    </p>

    <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Description of Image 2" width="600px">
    <p>
        Keep adding content like this. Each block of text or image will follow naturally as the user scrolls down the page.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can continue adding paragraphs, images, or any other elements in a simple, continuous scroll without any interruptions.
    </p>

    <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Description of Image 3" width="600px">
    <p>
        The goal is to create a simple and visually appealing scrolling experience, similar to what you showed in the screenshot.
    </p>
